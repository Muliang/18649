    should update this log with a list of ideas or suggestions you have
    for improving the project.&nbsp; This could include identifying bugs
    in the project handouts or documentation, identifying parts of the
    project that were unclear or confusing, and offering ideas for new
    features for the simulator.&nbsp; If you have no suggestions or
    issues for a particular project, add an entry that says "no
    suggestions" or something similar.<br>
    <br>
    Project 1<br>
    <ul>
      <li>No suggestions.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Project 2<br>
    <ul>
      <li>No suggestions.</li>
    </ul>
    Project 3<br>
    <ul>
      <li>For the time triggered requirements that were already given,
        we could not complete the constraint traceability as asked. So
        may be the project3 hold mention that it's only for behavior
        requirements that each row and each column should have at least
        X. </li>
    </ul>
    Project 4<br>
    <ul>
      <li>No suggestions.</li>
    </ul>
    Project 5<br>
    <ul>
      <li>No suggestions.</li>
    </ul>
    Project 6<br>
    <ul>
      <li>No suggestions.</li>
    </ul>
    Project 7<br>
    <ul>
      <li> When team members have doubts about the project and go to
        different TAs, usually we get different answers. (It has
        happened to more than one of the team members, so I guess it's
        not a rare situation.) This causes more confusion and is not
        helping us with the project at all. Hope it can be improved in
        the future. </li>
